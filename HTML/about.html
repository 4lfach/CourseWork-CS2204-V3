        <p>Welcome to Hong Kong Industrial University -- a dynamic and innovative institution committed to providing
          high-quality
          education and research opportunities for students from Hong Kong and worldwide. Since our establishment in
          1997,
          we
          have
          been dedicated to becoming a small-scale, high-level, and international university oriented toward research
          and
          innovation.
        </p>

        <p>Our campus covers an area of approximately 500 hectares. It is located in the Hong Kong Kowloon High-Tech
          Park,
          where we
          collaborate closely with institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Our faculty comprises renowned
          scholars
          and
          experts
          from home and abroad who are committed to providing students with cutting-edge knowledge and skills in 11
          disciplines, including
          Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Materials Science and Engineering, Electronic Science and Technology, Cognitive
          Science, Computer
          Science and Technology, Biomedical Engineering, Electronics and Information Technology, Materials, and
          Chemical
          Engineering,
          and Biology and Medicine.
        </p>

        <p>At Hong Kong Industrial University, we offer a student-centered educational approach that encourages
          cross-disciplinary
          research in an international environment. Our curriculum is based on international standards and is taught
          entirely
          in
          English. We encourage undergraduate students to join research groups from their first year, with approximately
          82%
          of our
          undergraduate students joining research groups by their third year and 100% by their final year. To broaden
          our
          students'
          international perspectives, we provide them various overseas study opportunities, including at world-renowned
          universities
          such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, City University of
          Hong
          Kong, and
          Peking University.
        </p>

        <p>Our faculty members are recognized leaders in their fields, with 321 tenured professors and 80% with overseas
          study
          or work
          experience. As a university committed to innovation, we have created an atmosphere on campus that supports and
          encourages
          entrepreneurship. We have established 370 spin-off companies, with 114 of them founded in 2024 alone. Our
          incubator
          programs
          provide students and faculty opportunities to connect with technology, market, policy, and capital resources,
          making
          it a crucial
          "power source" for innovation practice.
        </p>

        <p>Hong Kong Industrial University's strength lies in our world-class facilities and talented faculty and
          students.
          We
          are
          dedicated to providing our students with the resources and guidance they need to excel in their fields and
          positively impact
          society. Thank you for considering us as your academic home.
